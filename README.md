# File System Simulation

file_system.py contains the class creating the tree file structure for the file system, and delineates the specified commands as methods.    

main.py essentially simulates a terminal by integrating the class and class methods with user input.     

test_pytest.py is a file containing unit tests for the different functionalities of the program.     


To run the tests just run the test_pytest.py file within an IDE or Terminal (there shouldn't be any assertion errors).     
To interact with the program manually run the main.py file within an IDE or Terminal.
